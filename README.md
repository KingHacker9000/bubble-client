#### Description:

###### What will your software do? What features will it have? 
My Software Acts as an online register, that keeps track of students, within school property
It helps maintain safety protocols during pandemics or other epidemics. It essentially functions as creating a sort of bubble
in which students are assigned to their bubble (ie their class), so in case of a disease breakout, it ensures a mush safer and practical method of keeping the students safe and avoiding furthur spread, the teachers can use the app, to track the students, and make sure that a purticular room isnt crowded so that social distancing protocols are endangered.
it has an tracer sheet for each classroom that can be accessed by the class teacher, and the admin. it essentially acts as a contact tracing

###### How will it be executed?
It will be used by class teachers to track when a student goes outside the class (Bubble).

###### What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
1) I will need to learn either native app builing frameworks, and learn languages as kotlin,java for android or swift for ios, 
2) or use a cross-platform framework such as flutter/react native

For this application I have used a Flask App using Python as a Backend, and React Native App as a Frontend

#### Getting Started

##### Installations
Download and Setup Node and npm From the official Website
Use npm to install expo globally: 'npm install -g exp'

##### Getting the files
Clone the repo using github cli and cd into the directory

##### Starting the development server
Install the necessary dependencies
Run the app using 'npm start'

###### IOS
Install the expo app on your phone
scan the QR code from the development server from the camera and open using the expo app

###### Android
Install the expo app on your phon
scan the QR code directly from the Expo App

##### Next Step?
Go Ahead and change the code according to your will and help make the app better

#### How Does it Work?
